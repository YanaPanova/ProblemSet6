Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: No predictions as incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would choose the average value for the most accurate and inexpensive results, which is 10000 simulations
